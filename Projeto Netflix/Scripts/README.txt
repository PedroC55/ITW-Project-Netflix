AmplifyJS 1.1.2

Developed & Maintained by http://appendto.com

Thank you for downloading AmplifyJS 1.1.2! This download contains the source and minified versions of 
the complete AmplifyJS library as well as individual components.

[Usage]
To include the full Amplify JS library (Core, Request and Store) use the `amplify.js` or `amplify.min.js` files.

To use just the components you want, reference the individual `amplify/amplify.<component>.js` or `amplify/amplify.<component>.min.js` files.

* `amplify.store.js` and `amplify.core.js` are completely stand alone.
* `amplify.request.js` depends on `amplify.core.js`

[Licensing]
AmplifyJS is dual licensed under either the MIT or GPL licenses. Both licenses have been included
in the AmplifyJS download (and should be in the same folder as this file). View MIT-LICENSE.txt or 
GPL-LICENSE.txt for further details. Additional licensing questions may be directed to
